# KD-Trees
Implementation of K-Nearest-Neighbour Algorithm using K-D Tree and custom build Priority Queue. From a given dataset, it gives us the nearest neighbour and K number of neighbours to any given point.

To run the program, compile and execute the main.c file
**INPUT**
The input is taken from input.txt file

1st line: Dimensions - d
2nd line: Number of neighbours to find - K
3rd line: Number of input points of d dimension - number_points
4th line: the data point for which the neighbours are to be found
Then the data points are input line by line number_point times

For the given input file, the dataset repesent the following-
The columns are equal to the number of dimensions of the data points
**OUTPUT**
The program will give the K nearest neighbours for the given point.

For the given input file:-
Given the number of dimensions - 4
Number of nearest neighbours to find- 10
Number of data points given - 10000
The data point around which neighbours to find - {689-7890-55-909}

Output on terminal:-
